# LearningSpringBoot

This repository is for practicing the Spring Boot framework, which is a popular and powerful tool for creating microservice backend applications. Spring Boot is an open source project that provides a fast and easy way to set up, configure, and run Spring-based applications with minimal code and configuration.

In this project, I set up a database service that can store people entries containing their name and a unique UUID key. The database service exposes a RESTful API that allows clients to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the people data. The project is designed to be modular and flexible, so that the database can be easily swapped with different solutions, such as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.

This was my first attempt at Spring Boot learning from guides made by firecodecamp.org. I followed their tutorials on how to build a Spring Boot application from scratch, how to connect it to a different database, and how to create unit tests for all CRUD methods.
